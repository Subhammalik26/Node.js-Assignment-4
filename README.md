# Node.js-Assignment-4

Created an npm project with express using EJS template engine.

# Reason for selecting the EJS template engine:-
 
As I am a beginner, I felt that EJS is easier for me to learn. EJS is so similar to HTML so I found it easy. EJS actually uses normal HTML & plain JavaScript in the    templates which I found easy to implement. EJS has Simple template tags: <% %>. While using EJS I could manipulate it much better. I think EJS is way faster than Pug and  Handlebars. For these reasons I have chosen EJS template engine for this project.
